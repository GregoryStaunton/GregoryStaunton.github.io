<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>

Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<h2>What Kind of License Do I Need to Drive a Forklift in West Valley City </h2>
<p>According to a report from the Industrial Truck Association (ITA), more than a quarter million units were sold, representing a 2.8% increase from 2017. With the installation of a suspension lift, however, you can get a lot greater clearance. Mono Tube shocks with reservoir cylinder are constructed with off-road attitude and performance in mind. All terrain forklifts allow you to work in places where traditional forklifts cannot go. Rough terrain environments don't have to slow you down with Access Hire's range of all-terrain forklifts that offer greater maneuverability and keep the machine moving in the roughest of applications.</p>

<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads.
