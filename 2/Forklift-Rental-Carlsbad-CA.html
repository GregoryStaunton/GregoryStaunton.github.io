Forklift rentals are not inexpensive.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers.

Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials.
