A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>

<p>Report pallet jacks with a failing hydraulic unit. Our guide covers the most popular forklift types and the best uses for each, so you can make a well-informed, confident decision on which is the best forklift for your specific warehouse and its needs. All employees who work in the area should be familiar with the unique hazards associated with pallet jacks and the safe work practices expected in the workplace.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
<p>In addition to rentals, they also sell new and used equipment. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>
