<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity. This is used, for example, when the tires on one side of the forklift are up on a mound of dirt and the tires on the other side are down in a rut.</p>

<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models.

<p>A wide range of options allows you to adapt our order pickers to your own individual logistics profile. Sit-down forklifts come in 3-wheel and 4-wheel models. We'll make an offer on lift trucks in any condition. We are specialists in quality forklift equipment, forklift sales, forklift rentals, and on-site repairs of forklifts. The stand-up counterbalance forklift allows operators to easily hop on and off between loads.</p>
<p>REACH TRUCK: A self-loading truck, generally high-lift, having load-engaging means mounted so it can be extended forwardly under control to permit a load to be picked up and deposited in the extended position and transported in the retracted position (Fig. We primarily offer wide range of Forklift, Crane and other Heavy equipments on rental basis across all industrial sectors.</p>

<h3>Forklift Truck Used Woodstock VA</h3>
<p>Keep your credit line clear - Unlike financing equipment, long-term rentals have little impact on your ability to borrow money to increase your business. Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks. ProLift Toyota Material Handling works with our trusted manufacturers to carry replacement parts for all your material handling equipment.</p>

You can also hire our trucks for a longer fixed-term rental period, for up to 7 years.</p>
