However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>
