<h2>What Are The Different 'Types' Of Forklift Truck Thurmont </h2>

With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>

It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>
