<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations. Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance.

The Yale electric order pickers offer quiet, effortless operation and an abundance of features, all focused on ensuring operators can achieve faster, more accurate, order picking no matter the order picker.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
