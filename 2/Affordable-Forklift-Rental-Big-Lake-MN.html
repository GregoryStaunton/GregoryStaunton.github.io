<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

<p>Step 3: Choose Your Truck's Lift Height. POWERED INDUSTRIAL TRUCK: A mobile, power-driven vehicle used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier material.
