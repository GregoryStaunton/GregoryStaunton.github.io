<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels ) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer.

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
