Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst.

The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
