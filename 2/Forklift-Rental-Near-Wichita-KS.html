We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>This function is limited to some (Class 2 & 3) Reach Trucks”. Choosing the right lift kit height is critical to maintaining the comfort, ride quality, and utility of your truck. Despite this type of design, counterbalance forklifts aren't immune to accidents. Hand Pallet Truck with Weigh Scale is an excellent economic solution for all weighing requirements in a busy warehouse environments , which allows you to weigh cargo where you want and when you want.</p>
<p>In reality if you go through all the trouble of lifting your truck you will also spend most of you paycheck on other parts to put on it.

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.

Rough terrain forklifts do not require the operator to be licensed in the United States. The types of conditions that order pickers work in are as varied as the different types of warehouses or distribution centers.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation.
