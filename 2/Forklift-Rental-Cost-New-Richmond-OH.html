Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
<h2>Toyota Equipment New Richmond</h2>
<p>High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet.

In addition to standard models, TVH also offers specific models such as the silent pallet truck, scissor pallet trucks, weighing pallet trucks and pallet trucks for quarter pallets and fish totes.</p>

However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>
