We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.

Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician. The fall-arresting system must not interfere with the raising and lowering of the forklift platforms. Cat lift Trucks has developed two specialised order pickers to meet these needs. Guided very narrow aisle order picking truck - counterbalance type Order Picking Truck similar to the guided very narrow aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast.</p>
