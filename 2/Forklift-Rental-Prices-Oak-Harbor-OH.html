<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013. If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>This package has standard off-road wheels, but a 4-inch performance lift-kit and slim line fenders. Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks. Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material.</p>
<p>With a body lift, clearances are increased for larger tires without the changes to suspension height or alignment angles. You'll also read about the most popular kinds of forklifts, helping you select the right rental for your needs. Choosing the right tires will impact on your forklift's handling and safety. An all-steel low lift truck design with the same premise became the first 20th-century innovation that resembled the modern forklift.</p>

If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>

<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
