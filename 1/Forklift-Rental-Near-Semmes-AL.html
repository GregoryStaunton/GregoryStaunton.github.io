<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full reaward tilt, whichever is less stable.
