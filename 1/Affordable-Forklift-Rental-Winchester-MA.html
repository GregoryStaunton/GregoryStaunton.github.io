<h2>Narrow Aisle Truck Winchester</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Local Yale dealers provide service and support, just as they would standard lift trucks. Not every warehouse manager is ready to pay for rentals with cash.
