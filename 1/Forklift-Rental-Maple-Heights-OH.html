<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>WHMIS and Dangerous Goods certification, as well as forklift experience is an asset. Any contractors, employees and even temporary workers that may use a rough terrain forklift on the job must be trained, licensed and certified in rough terrain forklift training. We also offer drum lifter, drum lifter & drum are manufacturer of hydraulic hand pallet truck. The late ‘70s body sits on a full custom tube sub-chassis with long travel, four-link suspension, heavy-duty axles, and tractor tires, although the only thing this truck is going to plow is a mud pit.</p>
<h2>Efficient Forklift Trucks Maple Heights </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you don't have to wait long to get to work. Daystar "Comfort Ride" Lift Kits combine the best of both worlds in order to give you the most optimal suspension lift all while staying within a reasonable budget. Flexibility is critical for businesses and renting forklifts can be a surprisingly easy way to cut costs on a short-term basis.</p>

<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>

The unit is compatible with all types of forklifts so that you can easily move within your facilities.</p>
