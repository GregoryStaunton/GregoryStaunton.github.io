<p>Raymond 4000 Series sit down forklifts provide the visibility needed to maximize operator confidence, and minimize damage to racks, products, and facilities. It's the grandchild of the C5000 series, one of the most beloved forklifts ever made. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features.
