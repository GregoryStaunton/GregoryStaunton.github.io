<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly.

<h2>Hand Pallet Jack Sweet Home</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate.

Mainly for external use, the Toyota range of diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (petrol) engine powered forklifts offers load capacities ranging from 1.0 to 16.0 tons.</p>

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead.
