Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
