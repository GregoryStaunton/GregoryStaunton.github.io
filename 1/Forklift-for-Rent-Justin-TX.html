<p>Lift Code 4: Three Wheel Electric Trucks, Sit Down. It was fun driving different types of sit down forklifts. On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments.
