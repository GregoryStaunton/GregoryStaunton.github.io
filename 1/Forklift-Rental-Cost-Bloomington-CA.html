The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above. A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
<h2>Truck Lift Bloomington</h2>

<p>On the basis of end use, the global Pallet Trucks market can be segmented into food & beverage, retail stores, wholesale distribution, freight & logistics and manufacturing and others. Load Capacity or Rated Operating Capacity refers to how much weight the pallet jack can safely lift. Most warehouse forklift types can carry 5,000 lbs, though heavy-duty models can manage even heavier loads.</p>
