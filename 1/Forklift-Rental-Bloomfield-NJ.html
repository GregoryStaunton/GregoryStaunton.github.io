We buy and sell used forklifts, aerial lifts, rail car movers, attachments, racking & shelving and surplus warehouse equipment. The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>

<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>
<p>A few strokes of the handle provide 110mm of lift, the PMHE-102 heavy-duty pump is built to take thousands of pick-up and deposit cycles. As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test. Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>

There are other models that have an auxiliary mast that is mounted in front of the platform with pallet forks. We offer a full line of both new and used trucks, buses and trailers. Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>
