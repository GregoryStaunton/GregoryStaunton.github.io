The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack. Most businesses are cyclical in nature, so renting extra trucks will help a business through the surges of seasonal business. A reach is designed with two unique operator platforms. A person must learn how to drive a forklift while carrying a payload.</p>
