<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>

<p>But, I wouldn't be so quick to diss those who have lifted their trucks for better traction. I can have anywhere from 20 to 30 attendees representing 15 different companies (in the industrial, manufacturing, and construction fields) with each company using several types of forklifts. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. Better Equipment: In addition to freeing up capital , leasing a forklift usually results in getting better equipment than you could afford to buy.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
