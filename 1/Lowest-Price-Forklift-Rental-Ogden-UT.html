<p>Leading Manufacturer of hydraulic pallet truck, sewing machine lifter, wrap beam lifter, pallet truck, hand trolley and materiel handling pallet truck from Coimbatore. We have forklift hire & rental available for periods as short as a couple of hours and as long as up to five years. Acclaimed in the industry as a manufacturer and supplier, we are engaged in offering Semi Electric Pallet Truck from our extensive collection of products. By using the know-how gained from years of experience in production of industrial vehicles and the latest technologies, Komatsu markets a variety of lift trucks, including small-to large-sized engine-powered lift trucks, battery-powered lift trucks, and HST-drive lift trucks.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>Layman's Terms: The panhard bar is a vital ingredient when lifting a truck, it helps the suspension not to twist and cause excessive body roll. Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>

From a pallet jack to a telehandler, Lencrow Forklifts has Australia's largest and most comprehensive range of new, used and hire equipment. The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>

Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks.
