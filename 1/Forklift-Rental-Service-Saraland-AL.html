<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits. This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>
<p>Buy Forklifts in bulk from us for the best quality products and service. A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.
