However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Step area is 1.5 times larger with lower step height than fellow forklifts. The hydraulic pallet truck is very rigid, rugged and can take continuous heavy punishment in abusive Indian conditions.
