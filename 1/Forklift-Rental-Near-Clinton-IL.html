<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Our Lorry Loader training course (HIAB) delivered by Lift A Load Training ensures successful candidates have the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating a lorry loader. These high performers from brands such as Mitsubishi , Heli , Toyota , Hyster and Yale are ready for any stacking, moving, lifting or handling job you may have, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge. This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>
