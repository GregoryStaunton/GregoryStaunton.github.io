<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

<p>It's really yes and no. You don't have to earn certification for a Toyota electric forklift and a Caterpillar diesel forklift.
